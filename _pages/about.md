I earned my Master of Agriculture in Soil Science from [Sichuan Agricultural University](https://www.sicau.edu.cn). During my graduate studies, I focused on the effects of nitrogen amendments on key nitrogen transformation processes in alkaline soils. 

My research interests include soil nutrient cycling, soil-plant interactions, greenhouse gas emissions, fertilizer management, and the enhancement of fertilizer efficacy. I am also interested in developing predictive models for soil nutrient cycling to refine fertilization strategies and evaluate their environmental impacts.
